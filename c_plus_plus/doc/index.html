<h3> Winning a Game </h3>
<p> In order to win you must win more rounds as the computer (single player game) or your opponent (multiplayer game). </p>

<h3> Players </h3>
<p> There are two players:

<ul>
	<li> Single Player Game: the computer and you
	<li> Multi-Player Game: you and your opponent connected through a game server
</ul>

<h3> Score </h3>
<p> The game consists of more rounds. The overall score is displayed near the "Start new round" button in the "Start Round" Tab. </p>

<h3> Game Board </h3>
<p> The game board is a chess board like square grid. You must place 3 planes on the grid and the computer/opponent as well 3 on its own. You will not be able to see where the computer/opponent has placed its/his/her planes. 
The placed planes should not overlap and should not lie outside the board. Near the allowed area for the planes, 3 more square layers, marked with a different color are added. 
These will allow you to rotate the plane outside the playable board when positioning it.
</p>

<h3> Game </h3>
<p> The game consists of a set of rounds. In the Single-Player version the first round will start immediately when the program is started. 
The other rounds are started by clicking on the "Start new round" button in the "Start Round" Tab.
In the Multi-Player version the user has to login to the game server and join/create a game before starting to play. </p>

<h3> Winning a Round </h3>
<p> In order to win a round you must guess the position of the heads of the planes placed by the computer/opponent on its/his/her board before the computer/opponent guesses the same for your planes.</p>

<h3> Round </h3>
<p> A round has two phases: during the first you position the planes on your grid, while during the second you must guess the position of the planes position by the computer/opponent on its/his/her grid.
To position your planes you select a desired plane and then with the corresponding buttons in the interface you can translate it to the left, or to the right, upwards or downwards or rotate it.
 The selected 
plane can be changed with the help of a selection button. Once you have positioned your planes you can click on the done button to start guessing the computer's planes. Guessing
is achieved by clicking on the squares where you think a plane head lies. The computer/opponent will mark the square with a circle when you did not click on a plane, with a rhombus when you have
guessed a plane point but not a plane head and with a X when you have guessed a plane head. The statistic of your attempts is given in the left panel near the game board. 
Similarly a statistic for the computer/opponent's attempts is displayed as well. </p>

<h3> Logging in (multiplayer version) </h3>

<p>In the multiplayer version the player is required to connect to the game server. In the beginning one should register a username and password on the game server.
This is achived in the Tab "Login" in the left pane which will be shown immediately after starting the game in multiplayer modus.
Once the username and password were registered one can use them to login. 
After successfull login one can connect to a game or create a game togetheto play with another player.</p>

<h3> Creating or Connecting to a game (multiplayer version) </h3>
<p> In the multiplayer version there are two players involved. They should decide upon a game name and fill in the "GameName" field in the "ConnectToGame" Tab.
After clicking "Submit" there are three  possibilites: 
<ul>
	<li> There is no game with this name. The software offers the possibility to a create a new game with this name. </li>
	<li> There exist a new game with this name. In this case the user will be notified which user created the game and offered the possibility to connect to the game </li>
	<li> An older (where it has been played) game exists with this name. It is not possible to connect to such a game. Older games are periodically deleted from the database. </li> 
</ul>

The status bar indicates to which game the user is connected and with which player.
After  both players connect to the same game they can click on the "Start playing" button to start the game. 
</p>

<h3> Exchanging plane positions (multiplayer version) </h3>
<p>
Plane positions are set exactly the same as in the single player version. After deciding where to place the planes the data needs to be sent to the opponent. 
When clicking on "Done editing" the plane positions are automatically sent to the opponent. However it can be that your opponent has not decided yet where to place the planes. 
In order to get the data at a later moment you can use the button "Acquire opponent planes positions" or simply wait until the software reads the opponent's positions from the server. 
Once the opponent planes positions were acquired from server you can start guessing on the opponent's game board.
</p>

<h3> Exchanging moves (multiplayer version) </h3>
<p>
Guessing on the opponent's board is exactly the same as in the single player version. When you click on the board the chosen position is sent to the server and the server may send all the
guesses made by the opponent up to that moment. If you want simply to acquire opponent guesses use the button "Acquire opponent moves".
