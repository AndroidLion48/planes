# planes
Variant of battleships game implemented with Qt, C++.

3 versions of the game of Planes: PlanesWidget, first naive version,
PlanesGraphicsScene an implementation using QGraphicsScene,
PlanesQML an implementation using QML.

It would be nice if someone would come up with a graphical design
for the PlaneQML version.
