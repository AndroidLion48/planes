\subsection{Data Structures}

The PlaneOrientationData structure keeps all the information required to justify the position and orientation of a specific plane. It works as follows: the Plane object is stored as a member variable m\_plane, if the position and orientation of the plane are not possible the member variable m\_discarded is set to true, the points on the grid that still need to be searched in order for the plane position and orientation to be completely proven are kept in the member variable m\_pointsNotTested. At the beginning all the points on the plane are in the list m\_pointsNotTested. As the game proceeds different points in m\_pointsNotTested will be tested and depending on what they reveal it can be that m\_discarded is set to true. Anyway after each guess of one point in m\_pointsNotTested the tested point is removed from the list. 

\begin{lstlisting}
struct PlaneOrientationData
{
	//the position of the plane
	Plane m_plane;
	
	//whether this orientation was discarded
	bool m_discarded;
	//points on this plane that were not tested
	//if m_discarded is false it means that all the
	//tested points were hits
	std::vector<PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D> m_pointsNotTested;
	
	//default constructor
	PlaneOrientationData();
	//another constructor
	PlaneOrientationData(const Plane& pl, bool isDiscarded);
	//copy constructor
	PlaneOrientationData(const PlaneOrientationData& pod);
	//equals operator
	void operator=(const PlaneOrientationData& pod);
	
	//update the info about this plane with another guess point
	//a guess point is a pair (position, guess result)
	void update(const GuessPoint& gp);
	//verifies if all the points in the current orientation were already checked
	bool areAllPointsChecked();
};

\end{lstlisting}
