\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Game Description}
The game is a variant of the classical \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)}{battleship game}. The ships will be here called planes and are shown in \ref{fig:board}.

\subsection{Requirements Analysis}
We need an object that describes a plane object which should at least contain information about the position of the plane on the game grid, the orientation of the plane, the shape of a plane. Additionaly we would need a game board/grid object. It should not be restricted to a specific geometry, should know where each plane is positioned and how many planes there are. Since the game is played against the computer there should be a kind of strategy object that decides the computer's next move.
A graphical interface for editing the board and playing the game is also required together with the associated controller objects.
