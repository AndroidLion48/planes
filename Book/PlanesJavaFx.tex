\section {PlanesJavaFx}

The main components of PlanesJavaFx GUI are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item LeftPane - implements the left pane
	\item RightPane - implements the right pane
	\item PlanesJavaFxApplication  - the application class as needed by JavaFx
	\item PlaneRoundJavaFx - the game engine object
\end{itemize}


\subsection {PlaneRoundJavaFx - Use of Java Native Interface}

Because the GUI is implemented with Java and the game engine with C++, we used Java Native Interface to gain access to C++ code from the Java side.
