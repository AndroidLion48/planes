\section{Configure CMake}

After you have cloned the repository from GitHub, you need to install Qt.

In order to compile or generate binaries you have to use CMake either in command prompt or from a GUI CMake program. In Windows as well as in Linux CMake-gui is a GUI CMake program. In \ref{fig:cmakegui_planes} you can see a screenshot of what the cmake program will show after you give it the path to the project (the folder where the main CMakeLists.txt lies) and the folder where you want the project libraries to be built.

	\label{fig:cmakegui_planes}
\end{figure}

You have here several options which need to be set:

\begin{itemize}
	\item CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX defines the path where the project binaries will be built
	\item Qt*\_DIR are the paths where the various Qt libraries are to be found by the project. Usually you have to define Qt5\_DIR and then the others will be setup automatically.
	\item With\_Asan will activate Address Sanitizer support
	\item With\_Java has to be active when building for the Android application.
\end{itemize}

CMake GUI uses so called generators to define which toolchain is used for compilation. These need to be set for example for Visual Studio (as seen in \ref{fig:cmakegui_planes}), gcc, MinGW or any other toolchain you use to build the project.

Tested binaries of the project used Visual Studio, gcc and MinGW generators.
