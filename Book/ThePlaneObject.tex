\section{The Plane Object}
A plane object is defined through the position of its head  (plane front) and its orientation (see \ref{fig:plane_orientations}).  We assume that each plane exists somewhere in its own reference system and in its own rectangular grid - that is a plane object is not explicitly related to a game board object.

The implementation of the member functions of the class Plane is trivial. One thing requires an explanation : the class PlanePointIterator. It has to do with the fact that it exists nowhere in the Plane class definition an explicit representation of the points of the game board corresponding to the plane, in other words of the form of a plane. The only things that are defined are the point of origin or the head as well as the orientation of the plane. Thus the class is general allowing the use of any plane form as long as a plane head and orientation are given. In order to allow to work with the plane's form the class PlanePointIterator is used. It encapsulates the form of the plane but also gives a method to \textit iterate on the grid positions corresponding to the plane. 

\subsection {C++ Concepts}

\subsubsection {Class Definition}
Classes are the building blocks of C++ programs. They define properties of program objects as well as operations that can be performed on or with them. A class definition is a program block:
\begin{lstlisting}
class {
.......
};
\end{lstlisting}
Between the two parantheses  are included member variable declarations and method declarations. 

\subsubsection {Member Variable Declaration}
When object is seen as a box with pieces the member variables are the denomination of the placeholders for the pieces. The values of the member variables can be thought as descriptions of the object's state. Each member variable declaration consist of a type name and a variable name. The type name corresponds to the type of the variable, for example simple types as int, char, double or class types.
The listing below shows the member variable declarations in the Plane class.
\begin{lstlisting}
class {
    Orientation m_orient;
    int m_row, m_col;
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {Class Method Declaration}
The methods of a class are declared in the corpus of the class and are analogous to function declarations in C: in their simple form they consist of a return type followed by a function name which is followed by function parameters listed in paranthesis after the function name.

\subsubsection {Setters and Getters}
Setters and getters are methods of a class that either change or read a member variable's value. Normally the member variables are not directly visible to the user of an object, but only through the means of class methods of which the simplest are the getters and the setters.
\begin{lstlisting}
    int row() const { return m_row; }
    int col() const { return m_col;}
    void row(int row) { m_row = row; }
    void col(int col) { m_col = col; }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {Constructor definition}
Constructors of a class are functions that are always called when the object is created. One of their task is the initialization of the member variables.
\begin{lstlisting}
    Plane();
    Plane(int row, int col, Orientation orient);
    Plane(const PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D& qp, Orientation orient);
\end{lstlisting}
In the Plane class declaration we declare three constructors. The declaration is similar to a class method declaration except for they have no return types. The three constructors initialize the three member variables of the class Plane with the data that they receive as parameters. 

\subsubsection {Static methods}
Class methods are called with an object of their associated class. Static class methods do not require an object of the associated class. The Plane class has only one such method which generates a random number.
\begin{lstlisting}
static int generateRandomNumber(int valmax);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {Enums}

\begin{lstlisting}
    enum Orientation {NorthSouth=0, SouthNorth=1, WestEast=2, EastWest=3};
\end{lstlisting}
Enums are basic types for which the variable values are listed at the time of type definition. In our case the new type is called Orientation and variables of this type can have the following values: NorthSouth, SouthNorth, WestEast, EastWest. For enums the associated variable values can be explicitly converted to int. As shown in the example above the conversion to int can be specified directly in the enum definition. Sometimes one desires to avoid such a conversion and to enforce a strict type checking when assigning enum variables to values. In this case one should use the 'enum class' instead of the simple enum.  

\subsubsection {Access Specifiers}
Elements of classes (methods or member variables) can have specified different levels of access to the class user. These are 
\begin{itemize}
\item public, the element is accessible from all functions
\item private, the element is accessible only from the class methods
\item protected, the element is accessible from the class methods or from derived class methods
\end{itemize}  
In the code above the member variables have private access specifiers and such they are not accessible directly from functions other than the class methods. However setter and getter functions are defined with public acces in order to allow access to these members from everywhere in the program. 

\subsubsection {Operators}
Operators such as
\begin{lstlisting}
    bool operator==(const Plane& pl1) const;
    Plane operator+(const PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D& qp);
\end{lstlisting}
are syntactic sugar meant to simplify coding. For example, when defining \textit{operator==} one can directly write the comparison \textit{ plane1 == plane2 } with the meaning of a test of equality (if the operator definition respects the semantics of an identity test). 

\subsubsection {What is '*this' ? }
The function containsPoint(..) uses the operator '*this' with the meaning of the object calling the function. More exactly the constructor of the PlanePointIterator object with the name ppi receives as parameter the object on which the containsPoint() function is called.

\begin{lstlisting}
bool Plane::containsPoint(const PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D& qp) const {
    PlanePointIterator ppi(*this);

    while(ppi.hasNext())
    {
        PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D qp1 = ppi.next();
        if(qp == qp1)
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection {Function parameters and their transmission}

An important problem in a C++ program is how the parameters are transmitted (or passed) to functions. There are three important situations: transmission by value, transmission by reference, transmission by const reference.  

When we have a function which has as parameters of simple types (int, double, char, bool) we normally use parameter transmission by value, like in the example below. In passing by value copies of the parameters will be made and the copies will be used by the function. That means that, on one hand, any change that these parameters undergo in function code will not be perceived by the caller of the function, but, on the other hand, a copy operation is involved which for complex data types can be costly.

\begin{lstlisting}
void Plane::translateWhenHeadPosValid(int offsetX, int offsetY, int row, int col) {
    if ((m_row + offsetX < 0) || (m_row + offsetX >= row)) {
        return;
    }

    if ((m_col + offsetY < 0) || (m_col + offsetY >= col)) {
        return;
    }

    m_row += offsetX;
    m_col += offsetY;
}
\end{lstlisting}

For complexer function parameters we want to avoid the copying associated to the passing of the parameters and hence use references types for the parameters. As an example we examine the function containsPoint() from the Plane class:

\begin{lstlisting}
//checks to see if a plane contains a certain point
//uses a PlanePointIterator which enumerates
//all the points on the plane
bool Plane::containsPoint(const PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D& qp) const {
    PlanePointIterator ppi(*this);

    while(ppi.hasNext())
    {
        PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D qp1 = ppi.next();
        if(qp == qp1)
            return true;
    }

    return false;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The parameter of the function which is of the type PlanesCommonTools::Coordinate2D is passed as a reference, that is a reference to it is given to the function. No copying is involved. Had it not been for the const keyword before the qp parameter the function containsPoint could have modified the value of the parameter in the caller's scope (at the caller). In fact this is a method used to return parameters calculated in functions to the function caller (e.g. when more than one parameters need to be returned by a function). In our concrete case the parameter qp is declared const (see also \ref {Constness}) and the compiler will forbid calling non-const operations on it. Passing parameters as const references is the most employed method of parameter passing as it avoids a copy operation and forbids the changing of the parameter at the caller.
