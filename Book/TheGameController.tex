\section{The Game Controller}

The game controller is implemented in the class PlaneRound. Its member variable are as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}
	//whether the computer or the player moves first
	bool m_isComputerFirst;
	//the  game statistics
	GameStatistics m_gameStats;
	
	//the player and computer's grid
	PlaneGrid* m_PlayerGrid;
	PlaneGrid* m_ComputerGrid;
	
	//the list of guesses for computer and player
	std::vector<GuessPoint> m_computerGuessList;
	std::vector<GuessPoint> m_playerGuessList;
	
	//the computer's strategy
	ComputerLogic* m_computerLogic;
\end{lstlisting}

It keeps track of who should make the first move (m\_isComputerFirst), of the score (m\_gameStats) and of the moves made (m\_computerGuessList, m\_playerGuessList). The decision making is left to m\_computerLogic. The two game boards are modelled by m\_PlayerGrid and m\_ComputerGrid.
